NOTE, files contained in the wavetrans directory were _not_ written by me. They are the very nice code written by R. M. Feenstra and M. Widom, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. I am working to make a vasp friendly version of KIB, and happily it looks like this will do the trick. Their page can be found here: http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/feenstra/wavetrans/

*** I will be adding vasp compatiblity shortly (or at least I plan to, thanks to this: http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/feenstra/wavetrans/)
