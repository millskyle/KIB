# simple script which loops over iota or beta states and computes norm. If this value comes
# out at less than 1 (or very close), chances are you've made a mistake. Possible causes could be 
# the FFT grid is not the same on all three sets of wfns, you've not included enough unoccupied kappa,
# or some other user error

for file in iota???
